title: ! '"BISSAM: Automatic Vulnerability Identification of Office Documents"'
---
<p>BISSAM is one of our internally developed analysis system to faster react on malicious office documents. The aim of the system is to identify the vulnerability exploited. Our paper about the system was accepted at the <a href="http://www.syssec-project.eu/dimva-2012/" title="9th Conference on Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment" target="_blank">9th Conference on<br />
Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In recent years attackers have changed their attack vector from the operating system level to the application level. Particularly, attackers concentrate their efforts on finding vulnerabilities in common trusted office applications such as Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat. In this paper, we present a novel approach to identify the actual vulnerability exploited by a malicious document. We achieve this as follows: We analyze the malicious document in a sandbox. In this sandbox we open the document with the appropriate application and log information about the execution path by using binary instrumentation. This approach allows us also to identify embedded malicious code. In a continuous process we search for security-relevant changes in the vendor's application patches and automatically generate vulnerability signatures. Applying these signatures to the execution path log, we are able to determine whether a malicious document exploits a known security flaw and, if so, which vulnerability is used.</blockquote></p>
